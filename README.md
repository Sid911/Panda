- [ ] Native Android
- [ ] Web
- [ ] Containered Web
- [ ] UWP
- [ ] 2D Engine using Vulkan or DirectX

Platforms to be covered -

- [ ] Mac (cannot really test it)
- [ ] Ios (again cannot really test it) 

## UI Goal
Initial Mock UI Design looked something like this. Although please note that most of the major UI decisions were made while making the first project (flutter version) so this might have changed drastically.
